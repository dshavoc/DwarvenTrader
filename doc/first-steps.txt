== Server Users, Groups, Permissions

Set up user 'daniel' and 'ian'            
$ adduser daniel

Created group 'dwarves' (1003) consisting of users 'daniel' and 'ian' by editing /etc/group
    One main purpose of this group is to assign ownership of shared resources (notes) to it
    Added 'daniel' and 'ian' to group sudo.

(Note: To forcibly clear a password, one can edit /etc/shadow as root, and delete the password hash)

To add an ssh public key for a user, paste the public key on a new line in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    If using the public key associated with ~/.ssh/id_rsa (Linux) of the "local" (home) PC 
    then to ssh into the server does not need the -i option.
    $ ssh daniel@3.12.75.110

    If using a non-default filename, then the key must be specified
    $ ssh -i IanKey.pem ian@3.12.75.110

NOTE: ssh get pissed off (error 'public key') if you
    add one user to another user's group (/etc/group)
        daniel:x:1001:ian
        ian:x:1002:daniel
    assign a user to a different group (/etc/passwd)
        daniel:x:1001:1003:Daniel Kohler,,,,dgkohler@gmail.com:/home/daniel:/bin/bash
